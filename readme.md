## Install instructions

Extract and place the whole folder intact for each mod you want in your mods directory

On Desktop versions of the game, it loads mods from your `~/documents/CitizenOfRomeDynastyAscendant/mods` directory, creating the same if it does not exist upon game start

On iOS, it's the app's `Documents/CitizenOfRomeDynastyAscendant/mods` directory to which you can upload via iTunes

On Android, if external storage is available, it uses the `/CitizenOfRomeDynastyAscendant/mods` directory there, else it uses the same location in the app's internal storage

It displays the exact path for mods in the Settings screen after you enable mods once

Requires v1.4.0+
